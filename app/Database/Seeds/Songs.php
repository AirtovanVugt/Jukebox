                                       I've been dealin' with some things like every human being
                                       And really didn't sleep much last night (last night)
                                       I'm sorry, that's fine
                                       I just think I need a little me time
                                       I just think I need a little free time
                                       Little break from the shows and the bus rides (bus rides), yeah
                                       Last year I had a breakdown
                                       Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud
                                       Had to see a therapist, then I found out
                                       Somethin' funny's goin' on up in my house
                                       Yeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out
                                       You know, pack my car, take a new route
                                       Clean up my yard, get the noose out
                                       Hang up my heart, let it air out (air out)
                                       I've been searchin'
                                       What does that mean, Nate?
                                       I've been learning
                                       Grabbin' my keepsakes, leavin' my burdens
                                       Well, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect
                                       Lookin' at the view like, this concerns me
                                       Pickin' up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous
                                       Hate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry
                                       And things might hurt me
                                       It's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey (but hey)
                                       It's worth it, though
                                       Cold world out there, kids, grab your coats
                                       Been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam
                                       Lookin' for the antidote to crack the code
                                       Pretty vivid, I admit it, I'm in classic mode
                                       Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone
                                       Talkin' down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for crackin' jokes
                                       I'm lookin' for the map to hope, you seen it? (You seen it?)
                                       Been makin' a whole lot of changes
                                       Wrote a song about that, you should play it
                                       I get scared when I walk on these stages
                                       I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah
                                       That's when I start to get anxious
                                       That's when my thoughts can be dangerous
                                       That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred
                                       Forget what I'm saying, and
                                       Where'd the beat go?
                                       Oh, ain't that somethin'?
                                       Drums came in, you ain't see that comin'
                                       Hands on my head, can't tell me nothin'
                                       Got a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach
                                       Throw it back up like I don't want it
                                       Wipe my face, clean up my vomit
                                       OCD, tryna push my buttons
                                       I said don't touch it, now y'all done it
                                       I can be critical, never typical
                                       Intricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal
                                       Intimate, but never political, pretty visual
                                       Even if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though
                                       You call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable
                                       Leave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool
                                       Way that I been thinkin' is cinematic, it's beautiful
                                       Man, I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos (videos, videos, videos)
                                       Yeah, the sales can rise
                                       Doesn't mean much though when your health declines
                                       See, we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside
                                       That we try to suffocate, you know, hopin' it dies
                                       Try to hold it underwater but it always survives
                                       Then it comes up out of nowhere like an evil surprise
                                       Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies
                                       You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am
                                       The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place
                                       And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
                                       It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe
                                       Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay?
                                       Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face
                                       Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great
                                       You'll never be great, not because you're not, but the hate
                                       Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith (woo!)
                                       I am developin', take a look at the benefits
                                       Nothin' to meddle with, I can never be delicate
                                       Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it
                                       Take a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence
                                       Pretty evident, dependable can never be tentative
                                       I'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine
                                       Pretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip
                                       Proper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah (ah)
                                       It's that time again
                                       Better grab your balloons and invite your friends
                                       Seatbelts back on, yeah, strap 'em in
                            	       Look at me, everybody, I'm smilin' big

                                       But I'm okay with it, I admit the lyrics are weak
                                       I been workin' on 'em, I'll be good eventually
                                       I understand you gotta crawl before you get to your feet
                                       But I been running for a while, they ain't ready for me, ah
                                       I know this probably isn't really realistic
                                       And honestly, I might not ever make a difference
                                       But that don't make a difference, I'ma have to risk it
                                       I been crunchin' numbers, you ain't gotta be a mathematician
                                       And see the odds ain't rootin' for me
                                       I can't lie though, it's kinda how I like it to be
                                       The underdog, yeah, you probably think you know what I mean
                                       But what I'm saying is they ever push me, I'm gonna swing, yeah
                                       I could go to college, get in debt like everybody else
                                       Graduate and probably get a job that doesn't pay the bills
                                       That don't make a lot of sense to me, forget the Happy Meals
                                       I don't like the dollar menu, I would rather make a meal
                                       Huh? Make a mil'? Nah, I said make a meal
                                       Home-cookin', get the grill, how you want it? Pretty well?
                                       Everything I see is overdone to me, I'm not Adele
                                       But I'ma get a record deal and say hello to mass appeal
                                       When I grow up, I just want to pay my bills
                                       Rappin' 'bout the way I feel, oh yeah
                                       I just want to make a couple mil'
                                       Leave it to the fam in the will, oh yeah
                                       I just want to sign a record deal
                                       Maybe buy a house up in the hills, oh yeah
                                       Might not be the best in my field
                                       But I guarantee that I'ma die real
                                       When I grow up
                                       Yeah, ayy
                                       When I grow up
                                       Yeah, yeah, ayy
                                       I'ma make 'em notice me, rhymin' like it's poetry
                                       Everything I oversee, I just like to overthink
                                       Mockin' me, you pay the fee, no return and no receipts
                                       Those of you that don't believe, quiet, you don't know a thing
                                       Quiet when I'm tryna sing, quiet when I'm making beats
                                       Quiet when I'm tryna think, sorry, I don't mean to scream
                                       I just feel like no one really gets me and it's sad to see
                                       'Cause someday I'ma grow up and show all of you it's meant to be, yeah
                                       Anybody wanna hear me rap? (No)
                                       Come on, let me play a couple tracks (no)
                                       Come on, I can spit it really fast (no)
                                       You think I should throw this in the trash? (No)
                                       Tricked you, haters, go away before I hit you
                                       I am not a beggar or a kiss-up
                                       You don't understand? Well, I forgive you
                                       I am not a quitter, you ain't really think that, did you?
                                       Maybe someday I could even be up on the radio
                                       Have a tour bus and maybe even play a couple shows
                                       Everybody in the crowd singin' every word I wrote
                                       Tellin' me that I am not the only one that feels alone
                                       Huh? You feel alone? Yeah, I kinda feel alone
                                       Wonder if that feelin' ever goes away when you get old
                                       Will I ever make it as an artist? I don't really know
                                       Might not make a lot of dough, I'ma have to try it, though
